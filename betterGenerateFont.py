#FLM: Font Generator
# Version 1.6
#
# Provides a better method for generating test fonts. Makes a copy of the font,
# then removes overlaps, decomposes glyphs, and generates a font. It then closes
# the copy of the font, making sure that you haven't just destroyed the font you
# are working on.
#
# Version History 
# 1.6 Worked out problems with glyphs of many components, thanks to Claus Eggers SÂ¿rensen. 
# I've also sped up the path direction correction, answering Rob Kellers complaints.
# 1.5 Fixed a bug with OT Classes that was either always there or introduced in FL5. Thanks to 
# David Brezina for finding and fixing that & Karsten Luecke for getting on me to post the new version
# 1.4 Added in correcting path direction. Takes longer but no longer will glyphs appear bolder than they are.
# 1.3 Took out the option for font type. Save a step, only PS OpenType now. December 15, 2006
# 1.2 Took out extra, often unused, font generation options, see note in code. April 13, 2006
# 1.1 Added OpenType Feature and Class Export, May 10, 2005
# 1.0 First release
#
# Opentype Features
# If you link your OpenType features or groups in external files, for this to work you will need to use the
# full path when including your files, or they won't be put into the test font.
